\subsection*{Question 3:}

\textbf{Response 1:}

**Solution 1:**
*   Part a) – 4/4
*   Part b) – 5/5

This is a good solution with a clear and correct approach to the problem.

**Solution 2:**
*   Part a) – 3/4
*   Part b) – 3/5

This solution is partially correct but lacks detail. The student correctly identifies the need for integration by parts but doesn't carry it out. For part b), the student correctly identifies the need to apply integration by parts twice, but the explanation is vague.

**Solution 3:**
*   Part a) – 4/4
*   Part b) – 5/5

This is a good solution with a clear and correct approach to the problem. The solution could be improved by explicitly showing the boundary terms that arise from integration by parts vanish because the functions and their derivatives are zero at infinity.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 2:}

**Solution 1: (a) 4/4, (b) 5/5**

This solution is well-presented and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the problem. The student correctly uses integration by parts and explains the steps clearly. Overall, this is an excellent solution.

**Solution 2: (a) 3/4, (b) 4/5**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and correctly uses integration by parts. However, there are minor errors in the explanation, such as stating that the complex conjugate of a real derivative operation doesn't change the operation (while it's true in this case, the complex conjugate operation should still be mentioned explicitly). Additionally, the explanation could be more detailed in some parts.

**Solution 3: (a) 3/4, (b) 4/5**

While the student generally understands the problem and reaches the correct conclusion, the explanation is less detailed compared to the other solutions. The student skips intermediate steps in integration by parts and relies on the reader's familiarity with the concept. It would be better to explicitly show the steps for clarity. Additionally, the boundary term should be mentioned and explained.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 3:}

**Solution 1:**
*   Part a) - 4/4: The solution is complete and correct. There are no errors, and the integration by parts is performed flawlessly.
*   Part b) - 5/5: Again, the solution is perfect. The student has shown a deep understanding of Hermitian operators and their properties. 

**Overall feedback:** This solution demonstrates a strong grasp of the material. It's clear, concise, and well-structured, making it easy to follow. The student's use of integration by parts is particularly impressive. Overall, an excellent solution. 

**Solution 2:**
*   Part a) - 4/4: The solution is correct, but there's a minor issue with the notation in step 3. The differentials should be \( du = \frac{dg}{dx} dx \) and \( v = i\hbar f^{*} \). However, since the final answer is correct, it's likely a typo. 
*   Part b) - 3/5: The solution is incomplete. While the student correctly sets up the problem and mentions integration by parts, they don't explicitly show the steps. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess their understanding. 

**Overall feedback:** The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but needs to be more thorough in their calculations and explanations. The solution lacks the rigor seen in the first solution, particularly in part b). 

**Solution 3:**
*   Part a) - 4/4: The solution is correct and well-explained. The student clearly shows all the steps involved in the integration by parts.
*   Part b) - 2/5: The solution is too brief. The student claims that the boundary terms vanish and jumps straight to the answer. While this is true, they need to show the steps involved in the integration by parts. 

**Overall feedback:** The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept, but their solution for part b) is incomplete. They need to be more detailed in their explanations and show all the necessary calculations. The solution lacks the rigor and completeness of the first solution.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 4:}

**Solution 1:**
Part (a): 4/4 marks
Part (b): 5/5 marks

The solutions are correct and well-written. The solution demonstrates a solid understanding of integration by parts.  

**Solution 2:**
Part (a): 4/4 marks
Part (b): 2/5 marks

The solution is correct and well-written for part (a). For part (b), the solution does not explicitly show that the two sides of the equation are the same after integrating by parts twice.

**Solution 3:**
Part (a): 4/4 marks
Part (b): 2/5 marks

The solution is correct and well-written for part (a). In part (b), the student does not explicitly state the steps used to integrate by parts twice and to show that the boundary terms vanish.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 5:}

**Solution 1: (9/9)**

*Part a): (4/4)*

This solution is correct and well explained. It uses integration by parts correctly and clearly shows why the boundary terms vanish due to the functions vanishing at infinity.

*Part b): (5/5)*

This solution is also correct and well explained. It again uses integration by parts correctly, but this time twice, and shows why the boundary terms vanish.

**General Feedback:** Excellent solution, clearly demonstrating understanding of Hermitian operators and integration by parts.

**Solution 2: (7/9)**

*Part a): (3/4)*

This solution is mostly correct. It applies integration by parts to the right-hand side, but it does not explain why the boundary terms vanish.

*Part b): (4/5)*

This solution is not entirely correct. It states that the complex conjugate of a real derivative operation does not change the operation, but this is only true for first derivatives. The second derivative would require two integrations by parts, and the boundary terms would not necessarily vanish.

**General Feedback:** This solution shows an understanding of the concepts but lacks some details in the explanations, especially in part b).

**Solution 3: (6/9)**

*Part a): (4/4)*

This solution is correct and well explained. It uses integration by parts correctly and shows why the boundary terms vanish.

*Part b): (2/5)*

This solution is incorrect. It states that the boundary terms vanish when applying integration by parts twice, but this is not always true for the second derivative. The boundary terms would only vanish if the first derivatives of the functions also vanish at infinity, which is not a given condition.

**General Feedback:** This solution demonstrates an understanding of Hermitian operators and integration by parts but has an error in part b) due to not considering the boundary terms carefully.

\subsection*{Question 4:}

\textbf{Response 1:}

**Solution 1: (19/20)**
* a) (3/3)
* b) (3/3)
* c) (4/4)
* d) (4/4)
* e) (5/6)
* General feedback: Very well done, the solution is complete and correct. The only minor issue is that the reasoning behind why the commutator of the square of the momentum operator vanishes in part e) could be elaborated on more. Overall, this is an excellent solution.

**Solution 2: (18/20)**
* a) (3/3)
* b) (3/3)
* c) (4/4)
* d) (4/4)
* e) (4/6)
* General feedback: The solution is mostly correct, but there is a lack of detail in part e). The student states that the commutator of \( \hat{L_{x}} \) with the square of any component of the momentum operator vanishes, but they don't explain why this is the case. It would be better to explicitly show the calculation or provide a clear justification. Otherwise, the solution is well-presented and demonstrates a good understanding of the material.

**Solution 3: (19/20)**
* a) (3/3)
* b) (3/3)
* c) (4/4)
* d) (4/4)
* e) (5/6)
* General feedback: The solution is well-written and correct. The student could have elaborated more on the reasoning behind the vanishing commutator in part e) but the solution is still very good. Overall, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the angular momentum operator and its commutation relations.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 2:}

**Solution 1: (19/20)**
* 3/3 for part a)
* 3/3 for part b)
* 4/4 for part c)
* 4/4 for part d)
* 5/6 for part e)

Excellent solution! The commutator relations were derived clearly and accurately. The step-by-step breakdown of the calculations enhances the solution's clarity. In part (e), you could have explicitly mentioned that the terms \( [\hat{L_x}, \hat{P_y}^2] \) and \( [\hat{L_x}, \hat{P_z}^2] \) are zero due to the commutation relation between \( \hat{L_x} \) and \( \hat{P_y} \) and \( \hat{P_z} \) obtained in parts (d).

**Solution 2: (19/20)**
* 3/3 for part a)
* 3/3 for part b)
* 4/4 for part c)
* 4/4 for part d)
* 5/6 for part e)

This is a very well-written solution with clear steps and explanations. The presentation of the solution is neat and easy to follow. In part (e), it's worth mentioning that you have used results from part (d) along with the linearity of the commutator to show that \( [\hat{L_x}, \hat{P_y}^2] \) and \( [\hat{L_x}, \hat{P_z}^2] \) are zero.

**Solution 3: (20/20)**
* 3/3 for part a)
* 3/3 for part b)
* 4/4 for part c)
* 4/4 for part d)
* 6/6 for part e)

This is an exemplary solution. The problem is solved in a systematic and well-structured manner. The definitions and concepts are clearly explained, and the calculations are presented in a neat and easy-to-follow format. The explanation for each step is thorough and demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying physics.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 3:}

**Solution 1: (19/20)**
* 3/3 for part (a)
* 3/3 for part (b)
* 4/4 for part (c)
* 4/4 for part (d)
* 5/6 for part (e)

This solution is very well written and explained. The student has a clear understanding of the commutator algebra and the properties of the angular momentum operator. The only minor issue is that in part (e), they did not explicitly use the fact that \(\left[ \hat{L_{x}}, \hat{P_{z}}^2 \right] = 0\). 

**Solution 2: (18/20)**
* 3/3 for part (a)
* 3/3 for part (b)
* 4/4 for part (c)
* 4/4 for part (d)
* 4/6 for part (e)

This solution is also well-written, but it lacks some of the details of Solution 1. For instance, in parts (c) and (d), they could have been more explicit about which commutation relations they used. In part (e), they just stated that the commutator of \( \hat{L_{x}} \) with the square of any component of the momentum operator vanishes. It would have been better if they had shown it explicitly using the results from parts (b) and (d).

**Solution 3: (19/20)**
* 3/3 for part (a)
* 3/3 for part (b)
* 4/4 for part (c)
* 4/4 for part (d)
* 5/6 for part (e)

This solution is comparable to Solution 1 and the student demonstrates a good understanding of the material. However, there was a missed opportunity to directly show the expansion of the commutator for each squared momentum operator in part (e). While it's evident that they understand the concept, showing the work would make the solution more complete.

**Overall feedback:** 
All three solutions are well done and show a good understanding of the material. It is clear that all the students have a good grasp of quantum mechanics and commutator algebra.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 4:}

**Solution 1:**

*   a) 3/3
*   b) 3/3
*   c) 4/4
*   d) 4/4
*   e) 6/6

**Total: 20/20**

**General Feedback:** This solution is excellent, demonstrating a strong understanding of quantum mechanics. It's clear, concise, and correctly applies the definitions and properties of commutators.

**Solution 2:**

*   a) 3/3
*   b) 3/3
*   c) 4/4
*   d) 4/4
*   e) 5/6

**Total: 19/20**

**General Feedback:** This is a very good solution. The student demonstrates a sound understanding of the concepts. However, a minor point deduction was made in part (e) due to a lack of explicit justification for why each of the commutators with the squared momentum operator components are zero.

**Solution 3:**

*   a) 3/3
*   b) 3/3
*   c) 4/4
*   d) 4/4
*   e) 6/6

**Total: 20/20**

**General Feedback:** This is an excellent solution, showing a thorough understanding of the subject matter. The student clearly explains each step and correctly derives all the commutator relations.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 5:}

**Solution 1: (20/20)**
*   a) 3/3
*   b) 3/3
*   c) 4/4
*   d) 4/4
*   e) 6/6

This is an excellent solution, demonstrating a clear and thorough understanding of the problem. The student has correctly applied the definitions and commutator relations. All steps are well explained and the final answers are correct.

**Solution 2: (19/20)**
*   a) 3/3
*   b) 3/3
*   c) 4/4
*   d) 4/4
*   e) 5/6

This is a well-written solution. However, in part e, the justification provided for the vanishing of the commutator with the square of each momentum component could be more rigorous. While the conclusion is correct, it relies on an intuitive understanding of the conservation of angular momentum. It would be more complete to explicitly demonstrate this using commutator relations.

**Solution 3: (19/20)**
*   a) 3/3
*   b) 3/3
*   c) 4/4
*   d) 4/4
*   e) 5/6

This is a good solution with a clear presentation of the steps involved. However, in part e, the reasoning for why the commutator with the square of each momentum component is zero lacks precision. It states that these operators do not change the angular momentum component in the x-direction, but this needs further elaboration. It would be more convincing to show this mathematically using commutator properties.

Solution 1:

*   Part a) - 4 marks
*   Part b) - 3 marks
*   Part c) - 5 marks

The solution is mostly good but there is an error in the final matrix representation. \(b\hat{S}_{+}\hat{L}_{z} \left|l=1, m=0; s=\frac{1}{2}, m_{s} = -\frac{1}{2} \right> = b\hbar^{2} \left|l=1, m=0; s=\frac{1}{2}, m_{s} = \frac{1}{2} \right>\), so there should be a \( b\hbar^{2} \) in the corresponding off-diagonal entry of the matrix.

General Feedback:

Overall, all three solutions are well-written and demonstrate a strong understanding of the physics involved. Each student successfully derived the time-dependent solution, demonstrated the independence of probability density, and calculated the particle flux, along with its physical interpretation. 

While there are minor differences in the presentation and level of detail in the explanations, all three solutions are excellent and deserve full marks.

**Here is a summary of the key points covered in the solutions:**

*   The time-dependent solution to the Schrödinger equation for a free particle is given by:
    
    ```
    Ψ(x,t) = $Ae^{i(kx - ωt)}$
    ```
    
    where ω is the angular frequency of the wave.
    
*   The probability density of finding a particle at a given point in space and time is independent of both space and time. This means that the particle is equally likely to be found anywhere along its path.
    
*   The particle flux is a measure of the rate at which particles flow through a given point in space. The particle flux for a free particle is given by:
    
    ```
    $Γ = (ħk/m)|A|^2$
    ```
    
    where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, k is the wave number, m is the mass of the particle, and $|A|^2$ is the probability density.

*   **Overall:** 7/8

This is a good solution, but it loses one mark in part (b) due to a slight inaccuracy in the physical interpretation of the result. The student should have clarified that the velocity is related to the wave number, which is not necessarily constant for a general wave packet. Otherwise, the solution is well-presented and demonstrates a good understanding of the problem.

\subsection*{Question 8:}

\textbf{Response 1:}

**Solution 1: 5/9**

*   **Part a): 3/5**
    *   The answer is mostly correct, but it lacks rigour and clarity when applying the product rule and substituting in the Schrödinger equation. More steps should be shown to make the answer easier to follow.
*   **Part b): 2/4**
    *   Correctly writes down the Hamiltonian and evaluates the commutator \( \left[ \hat{X}, \hat{H} \right] \). However, it is unclear how this is used to derive the final result using the answer to part a).

**Solution 2: 8/9**

*   **Part a): 4/5**

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 2:}

**Solution 1: Grade 8/9**
* Part a): 5/5
* Part b): 3/4

This is a well-structured solution. For part b), the commutator  \( \left[ \hat{X}, \hat{P}^2 \right] = 2i\hbar\hat{P} \) could be explained more.

**Solution 2: Grade 6/9**
* Part a): 4/5
* Part b): 2/4

This solution is not bad, but lacks some precision and rigor. For part a), combine the steps where the Schrödinger equation is substituted and the terms are rearranged. For part b), be more specific about the commutation relations used to evaluate \( \left[ \hat{X}, \hat{H}\right] \).

**Solution 3: Grade 9/9**
* Part a): 5/5
* Part b): 4/4

This solution is clear and easy to follow, and shows a good understanding of the material. No issues here.

\bigskip    
\textbf{Response 3:}

**Solution 1: Grade 8/9**
*   Part a): 5/5
*   Part b): 3/4

This is an excellent and thorough solution. All steps are clearly explained. 1 mark is deducted for part b) because the student wrote that \(\hat{X}\) and \(V(x)\) commute when \(V(x)\) is a function of \(x\) alone, without any further justification.

**Solution 2: Grade 6/9**
*   Part a): 4/5
*   Part b): 2/4

The solution for part a) is good but could be improved by explaining why the product rule can be applied. The solution for part b) is very brief and does not clearly explain how to evaluate \(\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{P}^2 \right]\). More details of the calculations would improve the solution.

**Solution 3: Grade 7/9**
*   Part a): 5/5
*   Part b): 2/4

The solution for part a) is correct and well explained. In part b), the student claims that \(\left[ \hat{X}, V(x)\right] = 0\) because \(V(x)\) is a function of \(x\) alone and \(\hat{X}\) operates on \(x\). Although this is true, it could be better explained. In addition, the student's reasoning to show that \(\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{P}^2 \right] = 2\hat{P}\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{P} \right]\) is not very clear. More details of the calculation would improve this solution.

**Part a): 5/5**

**Part b): 4/4**

The solution is clear, concise, and correct.

Solution 2:

    *   The explanation of step 2 is not clear. There are no specific calculations shown regarding how the position operator operating on the momentum operator leads to the result. This is a crucial step of the derivation.
*   **Overall Feedback:** Good solution, but you should explain step 2 of part b) more clearly.

**Solution 3: (8/9)**

*   **Part a): (5/5)**
    *   The solution is complete and correct. There are no errors.
*   **Part b): (3/4)**
    *   The reasoning behind why \(\left[ \hat{X}, V(x)\right] = 0\) is not given. It would be beneficial to explain that this is because \(V(x)\) is a function of \(x\) alone and \(\hat{X}\) operates on \(x\).
*   **Overall Feedback:** Very good solution, but you should explain the reasoning behind why \(\left[ \hat{X}, V(x)\right] = 0\) more clearly.
