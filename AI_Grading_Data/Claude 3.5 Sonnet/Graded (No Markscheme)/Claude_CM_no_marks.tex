Feedback: This solution correctly identifies and describes the three cases of damping. It includes the discriminant and provides good qualitative descriptions of each case's behavior. The mention of the characteristic equation is a plus. However, it assumes \(m=1\) for simplicity, which isn't necessary and could be misleading. To improve, it should use the general form \(b^2 - 4mk\) throughout.
