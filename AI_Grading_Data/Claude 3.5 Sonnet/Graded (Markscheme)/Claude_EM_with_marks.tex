- Incorrect final answer (18A instead of 4/3A)

Part b) 0/3 marks

- Calculation based on incorrect current from part a)

- Final answer (864J) is incorrect

General feedback: The approach lacks the systematic application of Kirchhoff's laws. The solution misses key steps in analyzing the circuit, leading to incorrect results for both parts.

Solution 2:

Part a) 5/8 marks
