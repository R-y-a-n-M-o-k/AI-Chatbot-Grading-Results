\subsection*{Question 2:}

\textbf{Response 1:}

I'll grade each solution out of 6 marks based on the provided mark scheme and offer concise feedback.

Solution 1:

Feedback: Excellent response. All three cases are correctly identified and described. The mathematical conditions for each case are accurately stated, and the qualitative behavior is well explained. The solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the damped harmonic oscillator system.

Solution 2:

Score: 5/6

Feedback: Good overall response. The three cases are correctly identified and described. However, the solution uses \(\Delta = b^2 - 4mk \) instead of directly comparing \(b^2\) to 4km as specified in the mark scheme. While mathematically equivalent, this slight deviation costs one mark. The qualitative descriptions are accurate and thorough.

Solution 3:

Score: 5/6

Feedback: Strong response with minor issues. All three cases are correctly identified and described. The solution uses \(b^2 < 4k \) instead of \(b^2 < 4km\), omitting the mass term.

\bigskip
\textbf{Response 2:}

I'll grade each solution out of 6 marks based on the provided mark scheme and give concise feedback for each.

Solution 2:

Score: 5/6

Feedback: Good answer overall. The three cases are correctly identified and described. However, the solution uses a discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4mk \) instead of directly comparing \(b^2\) to 4km as specified in the mark scheme. While mathematically equivalent, this slight deviation costs one mark.

Solution 3:

Score: 6/6

Feedback: Excellent answer. All three cases are correctly identified and described. The solution provides clear mathematical conditions and accurate qualitative descriptions of each case's behavior. The inclusion of the discriminant is acceptable as it's accompanied by the direct comparison of \(b^2\) to 4k.

\bigskip

Solution 2:

Grade: 5/6

Feedback: Very good solution. All three cases are correctly identified and described. The use of the discriminant is a valid approach. However, the solution loses one mark for not explicitly mentioning the exponential decay in the critically damped and overdamped cases, as specified in the mark scheme.

Solution 3:

Grade: 6/6

Feedback: Excellent solution. All three cases are correctly identified and described, including the mathematical conditions and qualitative behaviors. The solution explicitly mentions exponential decay for critically damped and overdamped cases, as required by the mark scheme.
